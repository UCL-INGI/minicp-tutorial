    "In this exercice, we imagine you are running a Dial-A-Ride service. Your clients send you a request which specifies a pick-up and drop-off location, as well as a deadline before which they wish to be at their destination. For instance, you could have the situation shown below. The blue stick figures represent the pick-up locations, the red circles represent the drop-off locations, and the green house is the starting position of your vehicle (the _depot_).\n",

    "\n",
    "Your vehicle has two passenger seats. Your job is to plan the route you are going to take, in such a way that every request is fulfilled before its deadline. In other words, you must decide in which order to visit the pick-up and drop-off locations, such that every customer is picked up and dropped off in time, and the maximal capacity of the vehicle is never exceeded. Here the green arrows show a possible solution for our small example. Each green arrow also shows the travel time in minutes, you can check that all the deadlines are respected. \n",
